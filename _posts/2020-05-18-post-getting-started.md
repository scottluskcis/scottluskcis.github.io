This is my first entry using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to host my personal blog. Up to this point I have been using [Medium](https://medium.com/@scottlusk.cis/) for my posts but I want to get more specific with my writing. I intend to use this blog space for shorter posts that are aimed at specific approaches, technology, thoughts, code, etc.

Setting up this space I found it to be a little challenging at first as I am using a `Windows 10` box and am new to working with Ruby at this time. Overall it wasn't a bad experience just hitting the search engines when getting command line errors. Below are some notable links that I'll get added to the `README` of my blog repository as well.

* [Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
* Installing Jekyll
  * See [Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
  * In my case, [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)
  * Ran into some issues also referred to this [Running Jekyll as Non-Superuser (no sudo!)Permalink](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#no-sudo)
  * Had to refer to some documentation on Bundler [Using Jekyll with Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/)

Feel free to reach out and let me know anything you would like to discuss or see on this blog.
